            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen His Majeſtie heard that part of the Declaration which mentioned Maſter <hi>Iermyns</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, His Majeſtie interrupted the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> in reading, and ſaid, That's falſe. Which being afterwards toucht upon againe, His Majeſtie then ſaid, Tis a lye. And when he was informed, it related not to the Date, but the execution of the Warrant. His Majeſtie ſaid, it might have beene better expreſſed then; and that it was a high thing to taxe a King with breach of Promiſe. As for this Declaration, His Majeſtie ſaid, I could not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Parliament would have ſent me ſuch a one, if I had not ſeene it brought by ſuch perſons of honour. I am ſorry for the Parliament, but glad I have it: For by that, I doubt not to ſatisfie my People; though I am confident, the greater part is ſo already.</p>
            <p>Yee ſpeake of ill Councels, but I am confident, the Parliament, hath had worſe informations then I have had Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: His Majeſtie asking what he had denied the Parliament, The Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> inſtanced that of the <hi>Militia;</hi> His Majeſtie replyed, that was no Bill: the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> then ſaid, it was a neceſſary requeſt at this time; and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie alſo then ſaid, he had not denied it.</p>

And in all <hi>Ariſtotles Rhetoricks</hi> there is no ſuch Argument of perſwaſion. The Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon telling Him that the Parliament had humbly beſought His Majeſtie to come neare them afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; His Majeſtie replyed, He had learnt by our Declaration, that words were not ſufficient. His Majeſtie being then againe moved by the ſaid Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> to expreſſe what He would have ſaid: He would whip a Boy in <hi>Westminſter</hi> School, that could not tell that by his anſwer: And further ſaid, They were much miſtaken, if they thought His anſwer of that, a denyall. And being alſo asked by the ſaid Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Militia</hi> might not be granted, as was deſired by the Parliament, for a time. His Majeſtie ſwore, by God, not for an houre; you have askt that of me in this, was never askt of a King, and wich which I will not truſt my Wife and Children.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie ſaid, <q>The buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> will never be done in the way that you are in, Foure hundred will never doe that Worke: It muſt be put into the hands of One. If I were truſted with it, I would pawne my head, to end that Worke. And though I am a begger my ſelfe, yet (ſpeaking with a ſtrong aſſeveration) I can finde Money for that.</q>
